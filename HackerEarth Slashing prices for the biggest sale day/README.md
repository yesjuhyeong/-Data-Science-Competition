# 15th Solution and Code

I was 15th in the competition with 487 teams

Using Lightgbm, Xgboost, and Random Forest regression models and found the parameters as Random Search.

Lightgbm model considered categorical data but other model didn't consider it. Because it was boring.

I spent 8 hours writing the code.
